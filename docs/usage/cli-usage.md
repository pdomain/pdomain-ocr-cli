# Full usage options

This page covers every `pdomain-ocr` flag, grouped by what you'd use it for.
For the friendly walkthrough, see the [README](../../README.md). For
layout-detector specifics (the bulk of the layout flags below), see
[layout-aware-ocr.md](../architecture/layout-aware-ocr.md). `pdomain-ocr --help` is always
authoritative.

## Inputs and outputs

```sh
# Single image — output written alongside as page.txt
pdomain-ocr page.png

# Multiple images (any mix of files / directories)
pdomain-ocr page1.png page2.png images/

# OCR pages in smaller chunks (must be >= 1; default 4)
pdomain-ocr --batch-pages 2 page1.png page2.png page3.png

# All images in a directory (non-recursive)
pdomain-ocr images/

# Recurse into subdirectories
pdomain-ocr --recursive images/        # also: -r, -R

# Write outputs into a specific directory.
# When inputs include directories, structure is mirrored under -o.
pdomain-ocr -o output/ page.png
pdomain-ocr -r images/ -o output/      # output/ mirrors images/'s tree

# Also save the reorganized OCR document as JSON next to the .txt
pdomain-ocr --save-json page.png
```

Recognized image suffixes: `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.tif`, `.tiff`,
`.bmp`, `.webp`. Other files in a directory are skipped with a
warning.

## Text normalization

```sh
# Curly → straight quotes ('hi' "hi" → 'hi' "hi")
pdomain-ocr --straight-quotes page.png        # also: -sq

# Em dash → ASCII double hyphen (— → --)
pdomain-ocr --em-dash-to-double-hyphen page.png   # also: -ed
```

`--straight-quotes` covers the eight common curly variants
(`‘-‟`). Prime symbols (`′`, `″`) are intentionally left
alone — they're meaningful in measurements and citations.

### Planned: output normalization (post-OCR)

Not implemented yet — tracked here so users and contributors know it's
on the roadmap.

**Motivation.** OCR on old-typesetting books (Cló Gaelach, Fraktur,
early-modern English with long-s) may emit Unicode glyphs that faithfully
reflect the page: `ſ` (long s), `ﬁ`/`ﬂ`/`ﬀ`/`ﬃ`/`ﬄ` (f-ligatures),
`ſt` (long-s+t ligature), and similar. Faithful Unicode is the right
default for archival OCR fidelity. But downstream consumers — most
notably PGDP-style proofreading flows — want ASCII-equivalent text
(`s`, `fi`, `fl`, `st`, …) so volunteers see the same characters they'd
type. The user picks per run.

**Proposed flag.**

```sh
# Default — preserve OCR glyphs exactly as recognized.
pdomain-ocr page.png

# Map the standard glyph set (long-s, f-ligatures, st-ligature, …) to
# their ASCII equivalents before the .txt is written.
pdomain-ocr --normalize-output ascii page.png
```

Flag shape: `--normalize-output {none|ascii|...}`, default `none`.
Mode names are an open extension point for future locale-specific
profiles (e.g. a `gaelic` profile that also handles dotted consonants).

**Dependency.** The actual normalization logic + glyph map live in
`pdomain-book-tools` as `pdomain_book_tools.text.normalize` (to be added). The
CLI is a thin pass-through that runs the normalizer between
reorganize and disk write. This keeps the same map reusable from
`pdomain-ocr-labeler` (page-scope action) and `pdomain-prep-for-pgdp` (export
step) without duplication.

**Cross-refs.** Mirrors decision D-025 in the sibling repository path
`pdomain-ocr-labeler-spa/specs/17-decisions.md`.

## Model selection

By default, `pdomain-ocr` downloads fine-tuned weights from
`pdomain/pdomain-ocr-models` on Hugging Face the first time it runs, tracking
the latest revision of that repo. Pass `--model-version <tag>` to pin to
a specific release.

```sh
# Pin to a specific model version (HF Hub revision / tag)
pdomain-ocr --model-version v1.2.0 page.png

# Use a different HF Hub repo
pdomain-ocr --hf-repo myorg/my-ocr-models page.png

# Override the filenames within the repo
pdomain-ocr --det-filename detection/custom.pt \
       --reco-filename recognition/custom.pt page.png

# Use local .pt files instead of downloading.
# Both flags must be provided together.
pdomain-ocr -d ./detection.pt -g ./recognition.pt page.png
```

Local `.pt` files are loaded as-is. If sibling `.arch` / `.vocab`
files exist next to them, they're picked up automatically.

### Model trust boundary

OCR and layout model checkpoints are trusted inputs. The default model
source is maintained by this project, but mutable latest revisions can
change. For reproducible runs, pass `--model-version` pinned to a tag
or commit. Custom `--hf-repo`, local `--detection` / `--recognition`,
and `--layout-checkpoint` values should only come from sources you
trust.

## Layout detection

Layout detection runs by default when reorganize runs, and feeds the
reorganize step. Plain `--no-reorg` skips layout too; if you also pass
`--extract-illustrations`, layout still runs so the crops can be found.
See [layout-aware-ocr.md](../architecture/layout-aware-ocr.md) for the full picture.

```sh
# Skip layout detection entirely (faster, lower-quality reorg on
# pages with figures, captions, marginalia, etc.)
pdomain-ocr --layout-model none page.png

# Switch to the rule-based contour heuristic
pdomain-ocr --layout-model contour page.png

# Use a fine-tuned PP-DocLayout checkpoint (path or HF repo)
pdomain-ocr --layout-checkpoint ~/my-finetuned-layout/ page.png

# Tighten / loosen the confidence threshold (0..1, default 0.5).
# Values outside [0, 1] (and `nan` / `inf`) are rejected at parse time.
pdomain-ocr --layout-confidence 0.3 page.png

# Crop figure / decoration / table regions to i_<stem>_<n>.jpg
pdomain-ocr --extract-illustrations page.png

# Suppress empty figure / decoration / table placeholder blocks in the
# reorganized .txt (caption text is still preserved)
pdomain-ocr --no-illustration-placeholders page.png

# Per-step layout debug text (see layout-aware-ocr.md)
pdomain-ocr --layout-debug page.png
pdomain-ocr --layout-debug --layout-debug-dir debug/ page.png
```

`--extract-illustrations` requires a layout model — combining it with
`--layout-model none` is rejected.

## Reorganize controls

`Page.reorganize_page()` from `pdomain-book-tools` turns the raw OCR block
tree into reading-order text. These flags let you skip it, snapshot
it, or audit it.

```sh
# Skip reorganize entirely — emit raw OCR
pdomain-ocr --no-reorg page.png

# With --save-json: also write the full diagnostic bundle alongside
# the regular .txt/.json — six files per page in total:
#   <image>.txt + <image>.json                   (post-reorganize)
#   <image>.pure-ocr.txt + <image>.pure-ocr.json (literal OCR output)
#   <image>.post-noise.txt + <image>.post-noise.json
#                                                (after figure-noise
#                                                 removal, before reorg)
# Useful for auditing what reorganize preserved, dropped, or rearranged.
# The old name --save-pre-reorg-json is still accepted as a back-compat alias.
pdomain-ocr --save-json --save-reorganize-diagnostics page.png

# Warn (don't fail) if reorganize drops any words
pdomain-ocr --validate-reorg page.png

# [experimental] Enable drop of figure-internal OCR words during
# reorganize. Two steps are gated by this flag:
#   * Step Layout-2b — lines fully inside detected figure regions
#     with no body-text overlap.
#   * Step B2 — figure-internal heuristic noise.
# Default keeps all words. Footnote / header / footer / abandoned
# regions are NEVER dropped, regardless of this flag.
pdomain-ocr --experimental-drop-layout-words page.png   # also: --edl
```

Plain `--no-reorg` emits raw OCR and skips layout detection. Combine it
with `--extract-illustrations` only when you want raw text plus illustration
crops; in that case layout detection still runs for crop discovery.

### Always-on noise-drop warning

When reorganize removes any words it considered figure-internal noise
(via Step Layout-2b or Step B2 inside `pdomain-book-tools`), the CLI emits a
warning to stderr — independent of any flag. The warning includes:

- the page filename and the count of dropped words;
- a quoted sample of the first few dropped tokens;
- a hint pointing at `--save-json --save-reorganize-diagnostics` so you
  can re-run and inspect the full pure-OCR / post-noise / post-reorg
  bundle.

This is intentionally always-on so quiet figure-noise drops don't slip
past unnoticed. There is no quiet flag — file an issue if you need one.

## JSON Contract

When `--save-json` is enabled, each sidecar uses the same document
envelope shape as `pdomain-book-tools`. Downstream tools can rely on the
top-level keys `source_lib`, `source_identifier`, `source_path`, and
`pages`. `source_identifier` is the input filename, `source_path` is the
input path seen by the CLI, and `pages` contains exactly one page for
each image sidecar.

## Misc

```sh
# Print the installed version
pdomain-ocr --version

# Skip the background GitHub-tag check (offline runs, locked-down
# networks, or just to silence the upgrade notice).
# Can also be set persistently: export PD_OCR_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1
pdomain-ocr --no-update-check page.png

# Built-in help — authoritative listing of every flag
pdomain-ocr --help
```

## Installer behavior

The `install.sh` and `install.ps1` bootstrap scripts install the wheel
asset from the latest GitHub Release, not a git ref. Both always pass
`--extra-index-url https://pdomain.github.io/pdomain-index-pip/simple/`
so `pdomain-book-tools` resolves from the pdomain package index. They
default the uv tool environment to Python 3.13; set
`PD_OCR_INSTALL_PYTHON` before running either script to use another
supported Python version.

### Environment variables

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `PD_OCR_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` | Skip the background GitHub-tag upgrade-notice request (same as `--no-update-check`). |
| `PD_OCR_NO_GPU_NUDGE=1` | Silence the one-line "GPU detected but installed CPU-only" message printed on startup when `nvidia-smi` is on `PATH` but the `[gpu]` extra wasn't installed. See the FAQ in [README.md](../../README.md#faq) for details. |
| `PD_OCR_INSTALL_PYTHON` | Installer-only override for the Python version passed to `uv tool install --python`; defaults to `3.13`. |
| `PD_OCR_DEBUG=1` | On per-image processing errors, also print the full traceback to stderr. |
| `PD_OCR_REORGANIZE_STRICT=1` | Read by `pdomain-book-tools`'s `reorganize_page()`. When set, words dropped during reorganize raise `ReorganizeDroppedWordsError` instead of being re-added with a warning. Useful in CI to fail loudly on pipeline regressions. |
| `HF_HOME`, `HF_HUB_CACHE` | Override the Hugging Face model cache location (default `~/.cache/huggingface/hub`). Honored by the upstream `huggingface_hub` library — pdomain-ocr-cli does not read these directly. |

`PD_OCR_LAYOUT_DEBUG` and `PD_OCR_LAYOUT_DEBUG_FILE` are set automatically
by the CLI as an internal IPC channel to the layout backend (controlled
via `--layout-debug` / `--layout-debug-dir`) and shouldn't be overridden
manually.

### Conflicting flags / no-op combinations

When you pass a flag combination that can't take effect, `pdomain-ocr` emits a
`warning:` to stderr and proceeds (the redundant flag is ignored, not
fatal). The current set:

- `--no-reorg` + `--save-reorganize-diagnostics` — diagnostics are produced
  only when reorganize runs.
- `--no-reorg` + `--validate-reorg` — validation compares pre/post
  reorganize word lists.
- `--layout-model none` + `--layout-debug` — no layout model runs, so no
  debug artifact is written.
- `--no-reorg` + `--layout-debug` — the debug report is written from
  inside `reorganize_page`, which is skipped.
- `--layout-debug-dir` without `--layout-debug` — the directory is only
  used when the debug artifact is enabled.
- `--save-reorganize-diagnostics` without `--save-json` — the diagnostic
  bundle is written alongside the regular `.json` output, which requires
  `--save-json`.
- `--no-reorg` + `--experimental-drop-layout-words` — the drop is applied
  inside `reorganize_page`, which is skipped.
- `--no-reorg` + `--no-illustration-placeholders` — placeholder emission
  happens inside `reorganize_page`, which is skipped.
